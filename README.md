        - I adjust the following settings:
            - **Theme**: Choose a light or dark theme (`File > Preferences > Color Theme`).
            - **Font Size**: Set the font size to my preference (`Editor: Font Size`).

    2. **Extensions**:
        - I go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
        - Essential extensions for web development:

    3. **Editor Group**:
        - The central area where files are opened and edited. I can split this area into multiple editor groups to view multiple files side by side.

    4. **Status Bar**:
        - Located at the bottom, it shows information about the current file and workspace, such as line and column number, file type, and errors/warnings.

### Command Palette

4. **What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.**

    The Command Palette in VS Code is a powerful tool that provides quick access to many commands and settings. It can be accessed by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `F1`.

    2. **Managing Extensions**:
        - I disable or uninstall extensions from the Extensions view.
        - I update extensions by clicking the "Update" button when available.

    Examples of essential extensions for web development:
    - **ESLint**: For identifying and fixing linting errors.
    - **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting.
    - **Live Server**: For real-time browser refresh.
    - **Debugger for Chrome**: For debugging JavaScript code.
    - **GitLens**: For enhanced Git integration.

        - I click `create a launch.json file` to set up a debugging configuration for my environment (e.g., Node.js, Python).

    3. **Start Debugging**:
        - I set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
        - I click the green play button in the Run and Debug view to start debugging.

    Key features:
    - Step through code (`F10` to step over, `F11` to step into).
    - Inspect variables and call stacks.
    - Watch expressions and evaluate code in the debug console.

### Using Source Control

10. **How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.**
